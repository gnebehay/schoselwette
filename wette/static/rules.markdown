# Rules

## Payment
The participation fee for the whole tournament is **10 EUR / 12 CHF**. After registration you'll get an email from team.schosel@gmail.com containing the bank transfer payment instructions. In case you didn't get the email please shoot us an email at the mentioned address.

Every registered player **will be disqualified** if their participation fee is not transferred to the Schosel bank account **before the first match begins**.

## Price Money
The pot equals the sum of all players participation fees. It will be fully paid out to the best players. If you bet on the right outcome of matches and the final cup winner you collect points. If you make it to the top 3 of the score list you win some cash. Here's what's in for you:
1. First place 30% of the pot
2. Second place 15% of the pot
3. Third place 10% of the pot
4. For each achievement you win you get 5% of the pot

## Betting
You bet on the outcome of **all 64 world cup matches** as well as on the final cup winner. For each correct bet you collect points based on automatically calculated odds. During the group phase you can place 4 super bets which double the points you get if your bet is correct.

## Odds
Odds determine the amount of points you get for each correct bet. If many players place the same bet they get less points. In case only few players place the same bet they are rewarded with more points. Odds only become visible after the match started and no player can change their bet anymore.

### Odd calculation
Odds are calculated according this simple equation:

Odds = total number of players / number of players with same bet

So if you want to get more points, try to place a different bet than the other players.

## Achievements
In the past players often stopped betting during later cup stages when they realised they couldn't get to the first three ranks in the score table. This is why we decided to introduce achievements that you can win (and get some cash) even if you have a low score. You compete with the other players for the highest rank of each achievement. If you end first on the rankig of an achievement at the end of the cup you win 5% of the pot. In case multiple players score the same amount of points for an achievement they split the 5%.

### Gambler
Player with most correct bets on highest odds of matches.

### Superbet Hustler
Player who scores the most points through super bets.

### National Expert
Player with most correct bets for one country.

### Public Enemy
Player with most wrong bets for one country.

### Secret Achievement
There is one secret achievement that will be revealed after the final match. Until then players can only see their ranking for this achievement but they don't know how it's calculated. The organizers of Schosel know the achievement and are therefore excluded and can't win this achievement.

Have fun and good luck! :)
